There might be many telemedicine facilities around the globe and even in Bangladesh. But do they think about that person who earns not more than $6 per day or do they even think of that person who lives in a remote area and nearest hospital or clinic is 10km -15km away from their home?  Their only hope is that medical store at the corner of their local market.  Or do they even think of that young boy who is getting ready for his upcoming exam alone in the dormitory, while everyone is on vacation and now suddenly, he is sick and no one here to prescribe him or to buy him some medicine? We, Docmefy promise to give free medical consultancy to everyone.
